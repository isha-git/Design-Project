# Traffic Management and Emergency Vehicle Detection

<!--Machine Learning algorithms have been proposed to predict the traffic on a road throughout the day so that traffic management strategies can be planned accordingly.<br>
Further, emergency vehicles (such as ambulance) have been detected using OpenCV for better automated prioritization of vehicles.>

<!-- # Traffic Prediction
Decision trees are trained on the dataset provided by the counters. Our current model has been trained on a data of 1 year. Since, data has been collected every 3 hours, that leads to a total entries of 2920. Training a machine on large amount of data results in better outcome. Our current model provides an accuracy of 60 percent. However, with the passage of time, as more data is collected, accuracy will exponentially increase.
The general form of a decision tree is illustrated below:>
